   * real unit with rent $500, which would look like:
   *

   * |                     actual unit's rent
   * unitGroups.monthly_rent_min
   *
   * If a user sets the maxRent filter to $600 we should show this potential unit.
   * To make sure we show this potential unit in results, we want to search for
   * listings with a monthly_rent_min that's <= $600. If we used the
   * monthly_rent_max field, we'd miss it.
